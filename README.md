# Covid-19-Probability-Detector
This is Corona Virus Probability Detector which tells you the probability of the infection by taking some input from patient through some UI/UX in order to gives the result on the basis of trained data (done by Logistic Regression) of the other patients. So that it can be helpful as a real world project, by prioritization of highly infected people to treat as a patients firstly. 
# Libraries Used - Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Flask, pickle, request.

# Behind the scenes
In here, i didn't use the real data of corona virus patients, i used randomly generated data. If someone got the real data according to the respected parameters, then i would appreciate it a lot. Additional parameters would also be allowed.
There is jupyter notebook in there where i first trained it.

# Future updations 
Coronavirus map visualization(live) behind the UI of the detector and i have also uploaded the repo before for covid-19 cases notification that could also be merged in it and looking for hosting of the site.
